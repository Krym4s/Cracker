# Cracker

This project was made with  [Vladimir Lehterov](https://github.com/tndrd). This is app that could hack my collegue`s program in two ways: it rewrites byte code of my opponent program or it finds possible password with bruteforce. As password should have length of 16 bytes we can overflow buffer for password.
